##Getting Started##

Step 1-
Create our index.html, style.css, and index.js for our game.

Step 2-
Enter our boilerplate html code. If you are not familiar with HTML, JavaScript, or CSS there is an explanation of each of the pieces as we go along. If you are not interested, skip the breakdown section and just look at the code

-Explanation-

 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <!-- Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration. It informs the web browser about the type and version of HTML used in building the web document -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- This attribute is used to identify the language of information on the page. This information helps search engines return language specific results, and it is also used by screen readers that switch language profiles to provide the correct accent and pronunciation. -->
<head> 
<!-- This tag holds all the information that is needed to render things to the page but you don't want to display. Things like language types, imports, document titles etc.  -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>

-Just the code-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
